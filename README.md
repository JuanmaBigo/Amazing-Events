# Javascript-Mindhub
This project was a task for the Javascript course on MindHub

It's a page with different touristic events, it gives the user the possibility to see all the events, or only the upcoming or past ones.
Also features the use of cross filters, giving the user the possibility to filter cards by name, category or both.
There's as well a Contact page and a Stats page where given all the cards different calculations are made in order to show important information.
